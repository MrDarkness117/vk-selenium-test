# vk-selenium-test
 A simple vk selenium library. Implicit testing.

This is made for implicit testing. No future plans for this project, though I would like to implement more features for testing and practice purposes.
I also plan on introducing Pytest library.

To run you need Selenium: `"pip install selenium"`
It is preferred if you run Selenium as a separate venv. Activate the venv using `~/venv/Scripts/activate` (MAC/Linux) `activate.bat` (Windows) `./activate.ps1` (PowerShell)
Navigate to the library cd `./vk-selenium-test` and run `py main.py`

You can navigate to messages. Future sections will be available later.
Currently you can select messages and input text into the message field. Send a message.
